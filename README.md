# The use of lazy coding and NSCache for efficient data management 

Lazy coding is a method which is used by programmers  to postpone tasks when they are truly required. The program waits to act if it is requested for that particular activity or piece of information, rather than acting immediately. By delaying completing useless work until it's necessary, this enhances performance and can improve program efficiency.
The ability to store temporary data in a unique type of storage known as a cache is provided by NSCache, a feature of Apple's iOS and macOS development tools. Similarly to a temporary storage space, caches provide for the quick access of recently used or regularly accessed material.
When lazy coding is combined with NSCache, a programmer can put off performing certain operations until later and save frequently used or crucial data in a cache. When programs can access critical information rapidly and don't have to compute or obtain it repeatedly from the original source, they can operate more quickly and efficiently, saving time and resources.
